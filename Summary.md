# Vocatives in the speeches of Iliad, Odyssey, and Posthomerica

## Criteria

1. The category of ‘name-vocative’ includes patronymics and ethnics (‘horse-taming Trojans’, ‘leaders of the Greeks’); the category of ‘general vocative’ includes kinship and age terms (‘father’), titles (‘king’), terms of affection and esteem (‘my dear’), insults (‘dog’), or collective addresses (‘friends’).
2. Compound vocatives (type διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη, πολυμήχαν Ὀδυσσεῦ: Il. 2.173) or a combination of vocatives that belong to the same syntactical construction (type ἀργυρότοξ’,| ... ,| Σμινθεῦ: Il. 1.37-39) are counted as one vocative.
3. A vocative consisting of a name plus general form of address (type Ἕκτορ, τέκνον ἐμόν: Il. 22.82) is considered as one name-vocative. 
4. Particularized epithets of gods (type ἐννοσίγαιε for Poseidon) are considered name-vocatives.
5. Vocatives in embedded speeches (speech in speech), in the speeches in the  second song of Demodocus (Od. 8.266-366) and in the large flashback about Odysseus’ scar (Od. 19.393-467) are excluded. 
6. Vocatives that do not contain a name are called general, even though it may be clear to whom they refer (type μάντι κακῶν for Calchas: 1.106).
